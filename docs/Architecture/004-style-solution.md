# 4. Style solution

## Context

As the application grows, maintaining a consistent and scalable styling approach becomes increasingly important. A well-defined styling solution can help ensure that the application's UI remains cohesive and easy to maintain.

## Decision

After evaluating different styling solutions, I have decided to use Tailwind CSS for this project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and promotes a consistent design language.

## Rationale

1. Tailwind CSS enables a highly customizable design system, allowing for easy adaptation to the project's specific needs.
2. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach encourages the use of reusable components, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
3. Tailwind CSS has excellent integration with modern build tools and frameworks, making it easy to incorporate into the development workflow.
4. Tailwind CSS's focus on responsiveness and accessibility aligns well with the needs of modern web applications.

## Consequences

1. The use of Tailwind CSS will likely improve the overall developer experience by providing a more streamlined approach to styling.
2. The utility-first approach may lead to improved consistency and reduced cognitive load when working with styles.
3. The focus on responsiveness and accessibility will help ensure that the application remains user-friendly across different devices and user needs.
