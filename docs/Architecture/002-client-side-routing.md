# 2. Client-Side Routing Library

## Context

As the application grows, managing navigation and state on the client side becomes increasingly important. A robust client-side routing library can help streamline this process by providing a clear structure for defining routes, handling navigation events, and managing application state.

## Decision

After evaluating different client-side routing libraries, I have decided to use Tanstack Router for this project. It offers a flexible and powerful API that integrates well with React, allowing for dynamic route definitions and nested routing capabilities.

## Rationale

1. Tanstack Router provides a modern and intuitive API that simplifies route management in React applications.
2. Tanstack Router provides typesafe routing, ensuring that route definitions and navigation are checked at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
3. Tanstack Router supports route prefetching, allowing for faster navigation by loading route data in advance.
4. Tanstack Router offers excellent documentation and community support, making it easier for developers to adopt and integrate into their projects.

## Consequences

1. The use of Tanstack Router will likely improve the overall developer experience by providing a more structured approach to routing.
2. The typesafe routing feature will help catch potential errors at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime issues.
3. The ability to prefetch route data may lead to improved performance and a smoother user experience.
