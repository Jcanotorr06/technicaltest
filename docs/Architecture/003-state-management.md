# 3. State Management

## Context

When building complex applications with multiple components and shared state, managing that state effectively becomes crucial. A well-defined state management strategy can help ensure that data flows smoothly between components and that the application remains responsive and easy to maintain.

## Decision

After evaluating different state management solutions, I have decided to use Tanstack Query for this project.

Tanstack Query is a powerful server-state library, responsible for managing asynchronous operations between the server and the client.

Tanstack Query provides features such as caching, background data synchronization, and query invalidation, which can help improve the performance and user experience of the application, while keeping the client state in sync with the server.

## Rationale

1. Tanstack Query simplifies data fetching and state management by providing a unified API for both.
2. Tanstack Query's caching and synchronization features can help reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, improving performance.
3. Tanstack Query's focus on server-state management aligns well with the needs of modern web applications, which often rely on remote data sources.
4. Tanstack Query has excellent TypeScript support, ensuring a smooth development experience for teams using TypeScript.

## Consequences

1. The use of Tanstack Query will likely improve the overall developer experience by providing a more streamlined approach to data fetching and state management.
2. The caching and synchronization features may lead to improved performance and reduced latency in the application.
3. The focus on server-state management will help ensure that the application remains responsive and easy to maintain as it grows in complexity.
